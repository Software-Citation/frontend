                Yes, the Citation File Format (CFF) is an established standard
                and is not governed by the Software Citation Project.{' '}

                It is very easy to correctly cite a paper: all the necessary
                information (metadata) can be found on the title page or the
                article website. Software has no title page, the relevant
                information is often less obvious. People who want to cite your
                software may ask questions like:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What is the name of the software (given that itâ€™s probably
                    not <code>my_scripts/run.m</code> or{' '}
                    <code>analysis.py</code>)?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What label should I use to uniquely identify the version of
                    the software I have used?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What is the appropriate set of people that should be
                    identified as authors?
                  </li>
                </ul>
                The person who wants to cite your software will probably not be
                able to answer these questions accurately and consistently
                themselves, but you can! Give them all the right information in
                a <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, and they can cite your
                software correctly.

                We recommend sharing the Zenodo token for a hassle-free
                experience. We do not store any information, including the
                Zenodo token. Our servers store the generated CFF file
                temporarily (please note that it does not contain your token).
